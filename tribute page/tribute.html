    <h2>About a great Indian Physicist</h2>
    <p>&#x2022;Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman (1888-1970) was an Indian physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930 for his work on the scattering of light, a phenomenon known as the Raman effect. He was the first Asian and first non-white to receive a Nobel Prize in the sciences.</p>
    <p>&#x2022;Raman made significant contributions to the field of optics and is best known for his discovery of the Raman effect, which demonstrated that when light passes through a material, a small fraction of the light changes in wavelength due to its interaction with the molecules in the material. This discovery provided evidence for the quantum nature of light and laid the foundation for the field of Raman spectroscopy.</p>
    <p>&#x2022;CV Raman quit his government service; he was appointed the first Palit Professor of Physics at the University of Calcutta in 1917. </p>
    <p>&#x2022;While he was teaching at the University of Calcutta, Raman continued his research at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS) in Calcutta.</p>
    <p>&#x2022;Throughout his career, Raman held various positions and made numerous scientific discoveries. He also served as the director of the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore and was knighted by the British government in 1929.</p>
    <p>&#x2022;The Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to C.V. Raman in 1930 for his discovery of the Raman effect, in which light passing through a substance is dispersed and the wavelength of the scattered light is altered due to an energy state transfer in the material's molecules.</p>
    <p>&#x2022;In 1947 he was named director of the Raman Research Institute there and in 1961 became a member of the Pontifical Academy of Science.</p>
    <p>&#x2022;He was awarded the Bharat Ratna in 1954 and Lenin peace Prize in 1957.</p>
    <p>&#x2022;He contributed to the building up of nearly every Indian research institution in his time, founded the Indian Journal of Physics and the Indian Academy of Sciences, and trained hundreds of students who found important posts in universities and government in India and Myanmar (Burma).</p>
    <p>&#x2022;"He died from natural causes early in the morning on 21 November 1970 at the age of 82."</p>
